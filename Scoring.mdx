title: Scoring & Thresholding (0–3)
description: How to interpret Riskor's 0–3 scoring model, choose thresholds, and map scores to product actions.
---

Riskor returns two key values in its moderation response:

- **`violation_prob`** — Continuous probability (0.0–1.0) of scam/fraud presence.  
- **`final_score`** — Discrete integer (0–3) mapped for operational decisions.

---

## Score Meanings

| final_score | Meaning   | Recommended Action         |
|------------:|-----------|----------------------------|
| 0           | Pass      | Publish / Approve          |
| 1           | Warn      | Show soft alert or banner  |
| 2           | Review    | Send for manual review     |
| 3           | Block     | Block or require verification |

<Callout>
Riskor's **final_score** is already tuned for operational mapping. In most cases, you should use it directly rather than recalculating from `violation_prob`.

## `violation_prob` vs `final_score`

| Field            | Type    | Range  | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|--------|---------|
| `violation_prob` | float   | 0.0–1.0 | Continuous probability output from the model. Useful for analytics or advanced custom tuning. |
| `final_score`    | integer | 0–3    | Riskor-mapped discrete score, already applying tone/semantic weighting for decision-making. |

Example:
- A sentence with **`violation_prob` = 0.76** might map to **`final_score` = 2** if tone is suspicious but not strongly manipulative.
- Another with **`violation_prob` = 0.78** could map to **`final_score` = 3** if tone is assertive and matches high-risk semantic patterns.

```text
violation_prob      final_score    Recommended Action
-----------------------------------------------------
< 0.30              0              Pass
0.30–0.49           1              Warn
0.50–0.69           2              Review
≥ 0.70              3              Block
```

<Callout>
These ranges are an example. Your production thresholds should be tuned based on false-positive and false-negative tolerance for your use case.
</Callout>

## False Positives vs False Negatives

**False Positive (FP)**: Safe content flagged as violating — harms user trust and increases review workload.

**False Negative (FN)**: Harmful content not flagged — increases platform risk.

**Tuning trade-offs:**
- Lower threshold → Fewer FNs, more FPs.
- Higher threshold → Fewer FPs, more FNs.

**Recommendations:**
- Start with Riskor's default mapping.
- Review flagged content weekly.
- Adjust thresholds per channel (chat, posts, support tickets).

## Example Pseudocode

```javascript
function mapScoreToAction(final_score) {
  switch (final_score) {
    case 0: return "approve";
    case 1: return "warn";
    case 2: return "send_to_review";
    case 3: return "block";
  }
}
```

You can customize thresholds and actions with a JSON mapping:
