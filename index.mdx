title: Overview
description: One-page introduction to Riskor — Scam & Fraud Detection API. Understand what it does, why choose it, and how the 0–3 scoring works.
---


Riskor is a **Scam & Fraud Detection API** purpose-built to identify manipulative, deceptive, and fraudulent language in text.  
It goes beyond keyword detection, analyzing both **tone** and **semantic signals** to accurately flag **gray-area content** that traditional models often miss.

---

## Why Choose Riskor
- **Purpose-built for fraud prevention** — not a generic moderation model.
- **Tone + semantics awareness** — detects changes in intent based on emotional delivery or subtle persuasion tactics.
- **Gray-zone detection** — flags borderline cases that don’t contain obvious scam keywords but still present risk.
- **Actionable output** — provides a `final_score` (0–3) that can directly map to your moderation actions.

---

## Supported Languages & Platforms
- **Languages**: English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese (more available via Beta request).
- **Platforms**: Standard HTTPS API with cURL, Node.js, and Python support.
- **Environments**: Both **Sandbox** and **Production** API keys are available for testing and live deployment.

## The 0–3 Scoring Model

| final_score | Meaning   | Recommended Action         |
|------------:|-----------|----------------------------|
| 0           | Pass      | Publish / Approve          |
| 1           | Warn      | Soft alert, banner notice  |
| 2           | Review    | Send for manual review     |
| 3           | Block     | Block or require verification |
