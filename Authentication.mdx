description: How to securely authenticate with the Riskor API using Bearer tokens, rotate keys, and avoid common authentication issues.
---


All Riskor API requests require authentication with a **Bearer token** (API key).  
Without a valid key, your request will be rejected with an HTTP `401` or `403`.

---

## Authentication Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an API Key">
    Create your API key in the Riskor Dashboard.
    - Choose **Sandbox** for testing or **Production** for live traffic.
    - Each key is environment-specific.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Keys Securely">
    - Keep API keys **out of version control** (e.g., `.env` file, secrets manager).
    - Restrict keys to the minimum scope needed for your integration.
    - Do not embed keys directly in client-side code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Key in Request Header">
    Include your key in the <code>Authorization</code> header:

    ```http
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

    <Callout>
    Never append your API key to the URL — it risks exposure in logs or caches.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    - Issue a new key from the dashboard.
    - Update your services to use the new key.
    - Revoke the old key once migration is confirmed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Header Format

| Header          | Value                            | Required |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`            | Yes      |
| `Content-Type`  | `application/json`               | Yes      |

## Common Authentication Errors

| Status | Cause | Fix |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or malformed `Authorization` header | Verify `"Bearer "` prefix and no extra spaces |
| `403 Forbidden` | Invalid, expired, or revoked API key | Check key status in dashboard; rotate if needed |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Exceeded rate limits | See [Rate Limits & Quotas](/rate-limits-and-quotas) |

## Security Best Practices

- Use **separate keys** for development, staging, and production.
- Keep **short lifespans** for keys in sensitive environments.
- Monitor API key usage in the dashboard.
- Revoke any key suspected to be compromised.
