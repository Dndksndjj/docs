description: The fastest path from zero to a working Riskor text moderation integration
---

This guide takes you from **no integration** to a **working Riskor text moderation pipeline** in the shortest path possible.

You will learn:
- The request parameters required for text moderation
- How to run **synchronous** requests for real-time results
- How to run **asynchronous** jobs for large batches

<Note>
This page assumes you already have an API key and know how to authenticate. If not, start with Getting Started and Authentication.

## Synchronous (Real-Time) Request

Best for **chat messages, live support, and small payloads** where you need instant feedback.

### Request

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/text-moderate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RISKOR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "I can triple your investment in 10 days.",
    "language": "en",
    "threshold": 2
  }'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "task_id": "t_sync_9f3a21",
  "text": "I can triple your investment in 10 days.",
  "violation_prob": 0.91,
  "final_score": 3,
  "subcategory": "Unrealistic Profit Timeline",
  "tone": "Manipulative",
  "semanticType": "Promotional Pressure"
}
```

## Asynchronous (Batch-Friendly) Request

Use when:
- You have **hundreds or thousands of texts** to process
- Latency is not critical
- You want to avoid webhook setup and prefer polling

### Step 1: Submit a Batch Job

Send a batch of texts to be processed in the background.

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/text-moderate/async" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RISKOR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "texts": [
      "This opportunity guarantees a 200% return.",
      "Please send me your credit card details to process the refund."
    ],
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "task_id": "t_async_54af1d",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### Step 2: Poll for Job Status

Query the job status until it is complete.

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/text-moderate/async/status?t=t_async_54af1d" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RISKOR_API_KEY"
```

**Example status:**

```json
{
  "task_id": "t_async_54af1d",
  "status": "processing"
}
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Results

Fetch the results when the job is done.

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/text-moderate/async/result?t=t_async_54af1d" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RISKOR_API_KEY"
```

**Example batch results:**

```json
[
  {
    "text": "This opportunity guarantees a 200% return.",
    "final_score": 3
  },
  {
    "text": "Please send me your credit card details to process the refund.",
    "final_score": 3
  }
]
```
